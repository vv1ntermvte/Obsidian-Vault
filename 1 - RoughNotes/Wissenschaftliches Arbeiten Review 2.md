Notes: In 1.3 Scope of this Paper, it is stated, that the Authors of \textit{Canoncial Rule Models} argue that the main problem of rule-based systems are not the rules themselves, but the way they are combined. This doesn't seem entirely coherent, as during the introduction of symbolic rule-based approaches within chapter 1.2, no downsides of this method are mentioned at all. To improve upon this, i would advise to already talk about the problems with symbolic rule-based methods in this section. What exactly is troublesome about the combination of rules in previous methods? 

Title: Diffusion-Based Fact Embeddings vs. Canonical Rule Models for Knowledge Graph Completion

Summary:
\textit{Diffusion-Based Fact Embeddings vs. Canonical Rule Models for Knowledge Graph Completion} provides a comparative analysis of two contemporary state-of-the-art paradigms in the field of link prediction: \textit{Canonocial Rule Models} and \textit{Fact Embedding through Diffusion Model (FDM)}. Both models are extensions of previous previous approaches to knowledge graph completion,  \textit{embedding-based} methods and \textit{symbolic rule-based} methods, respectively. The paper specifically examines how \textit{Canonical Rule Models} addresses the known problem in rule-based reasoning of aggregating rules that make similar predictions by utilizing learned weights via logistic regression, improving performance while preserving explainability and efficiency. In parallel, the paper explores \textit{FDM}, which reinterpretes the entity prediction process as a conditional fact generation task, leveraging diffusion technology to learn complex fact distributions. By evaluating these methodologies based on efficiency, transparency, and predictive power, it is illustrated that the optimal choice between a white-box \textit{symbolic rule-based} approach and a black-box \textit{neural generative} model is largely dependent on the complexity of the underlying dataset and the specific requirements for interpretability.

At large, the paper certainly provides an educational benefit to the reader. The completeness of knowledge graph is an important goal for many subsequent applications, so the overall theme is by all means relevant. The paper outlines the different previous approaches very well and makes it clear to the reader that the benefits of \textit{FDM} are outstanding performance in predicting links, while coming at the cost of high computational resources and not being humanly comprehensible, and that \textit{Canonical Rule Models}, on the other hand, is much less computationally demanding and provides explanations for every prediction made but doesn't hold up with \textit{FDM} in complex scenarios. This takeaway makes it clear, why the usage of both approaches can be justified in different cases. The literature used to arrive at this conclusion, overall seems to be of great quality, an was, to a great share, rather recently published. Resources consistently stem from renowned conferences that only publish peer reviewed work and are cited frequently throughout the paper. The citations themselves are styled uniformly, however they lack a hyperlink to the source, that would have been nice for an easier and faster access.
