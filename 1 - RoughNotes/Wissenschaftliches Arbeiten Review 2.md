Notes: In 1.3 Scope of this Paper, it is stated, that the Authors of \textit{Canoncial Rule Models} argue that the main problem of rule-based systems are not the rules themselves, but the way they are combined. This doesn't seem entirely coherent, as during the introduction of symbolic rule-based approaches within chapter 1.2, no downsides of this method are mentioned at all. To improve upon this, i would advise to already talk about the problems with symbolic rule-based methods in this section. What exactly is troublesome about the combination of rules in previous methods?
